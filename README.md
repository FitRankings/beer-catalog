## Instructions
```
The objective of this project is to build a craft beer catalog that can be sorted by name and abv
(alcohol by volume). Please create a public repo for your work and commit after completing each of the steps below.

To Do:
1) Make an API call to "https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers" this will return a list of craft beers. Use fetch(), https://mzl.la/1YBLmMu, to make the API call. Here is the documentation for this API, "https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2". Tip: API response returns an array instead of an object(dict).

3) Use your creative design skills to make a catalog (UI/UX). Use your discretion on what information
to display from the API response. Bonus: Use Bootstrap (already installed) https://bit.ly/2RAtlUo.

4) Use the stateless component in Beer.jsx to display each beer in your catalog.

5) Features:
 [] Allow the catalog to sort the craft beers by name and abv (alcohol by volume).
 [] Add pagination with the API's `?page` parameter to navigate the catalog's beer 

6) Create a file `service.js` in the /src directory and a JavaScript class named, `Service`. Refactor your work to use class methods to perform your API requests and to manipulate the responses.

Bonus => Add search functionality using the API's `?beer_name` parameter.

Getting Start:
1) Download the project, it has the initial angular set up and essential libraries needed,
such as angular materials and $resource.

2) If using additional libraries, add the CDN import to publc/index.html file or install with npm.
